# neetcode150

These are the reviews for the 150 questions in Neetcode.

Each question has different attempts / answers.

## Why ? ðŸ¤”

Because the perfect solution **without any comment line** does not have **value** to a beginner.

Seeing how someone attempts to solve a problem (and fails to do so) is precious.

Fail forward.

Keep going.
